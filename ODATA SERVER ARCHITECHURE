An OData server consists of OData Producers and an HTTP server.

OData Producers:-
In SQL Anywhere, an OData Producer is a Java Servlet that uses the JDBC API to connect to a database server. An OData Producer processes OData requests and interfaces with the database.
The following table illustrates how an OData Producer maps OData concepts to relational database concepts:
OData Concept	Database Equivalent
Entity
Row
Entity type
Table or view schema
Entity Set
Table rows, where each row is an entity type instance
Key
Primary key
Association and Navigation Properties
Foreign key
Property
Column or column value

HTTP server:-

An HTTP Server
An HTTP server handles OData requests from web clients.

The database server uses the Jetty WebServer as its HTTP server for OData. This HTTP server acts as a Java Servlet container, which is required to host OData Producers
