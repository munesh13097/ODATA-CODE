Complex types consist of a list of properties with no key, and can therefore only exist as properties of a containing entity or as a temporary value. 
You can use complex types to group fields together without exposing them as an independent OData entity. 
Complex types can contain complex types, that is, they can be deep. 
Within a complex type the cardinality is always 1:1.
